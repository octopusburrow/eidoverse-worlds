# The eidoverse world-log protocol, v1

**License: CC0 1.0 (public domain).** This document and the fixtures beside
it may be implemented, copied, and modified by anyone, from any codebase,
under any license, without permission or attribution. The reference
implementation in this repository is separately licensed (AGPL); *the
contract is free*. SMTP being free is what made the mail ecosystem exist.

Status: v1, normative for logs whose `genesis` entry says `dialect:
"eidoverse-log", v: 1`. The words MUST/SHOULD/MAY are used in the RFC-2119
sense. Where this document and the reference implementation disagree, the
implementation has a bug — file it.

## 0. The one idea

**A world is its log.** There is no scene file. The log is an append-only,
totally ordered sequence of *intent verbs*; folding it from the beginning
yields the world, on every implementation, at any time, forever. Everything
else — snapshots, clients, servers — is derived cache or transport.

## 1. The log

- Serialization: JSON Lines. One entry per line, UTF-8, no NUL bytes.
- Entry shape: `{ "seq": int, "ts": int, "actor": string, "verb": string,
  "args": object }`.
  - `seq`: dense, starts at 0, never renumbered. `ts`: epoch milliseconds,
    the sequencer's clock. `actor`: who spoke (§6). `args`: verb-specific.
- A fresh log MUST open with `{verb: "genesis", args: {v: 1, dialect:
  "eidoverse-log"}}` (actor `world`). Readers MUST treat an absent genesis
  as v1 (logs predate the marker).
- **Folding is total.** No entry may error a fold: malformed or unknown
  entries shape nothing, and the log keeps them. A replay must never fail
  and never kick anyone.
- **Unknown verbs and unknown component types MUST be preserved**, not
  dropped. This is the entire forward-compatibility story.

## 2. Folded state

Folding produces, at minimum:

```jsonc
{
  "entities": { "<id>": { "pos": [x,y,z], "yaw": r, "lib": "path",   // things
                           "scale": s?, "actor": who, "ts": ms, "collide"?,
                           "kind": "light"?, "color"?, "intensity"?, "range"?, "keep"?, "day"?,
                           "comp": { "<type>": <opaque data> }?,      // §4
                           "parent": { "to", "slot"?, "offset"?, "yaw"? }? } },
  "mounts": { "<body-id>": { "to", "slot"?, "offset"?, "yaw"? } }?,   // §5
  "roles":  { "<id>": { "role": "owner|builder|visitor", "gen"?: true,
                         "sub"?: "durable id" } },                    // §7
  "behaviors": { "<id>": { "src", "attach"?, "caps"?, "knobs"?,
                            "author", "ts", "state"? } }?             // §8
}
```

Implementations MAY fold more (chat windows, ban lists); conformance is
measured on the fields above (see `fixtures/README.md`).

## 3. Verbs and their fold semantics (normative)

| verb | args | fold effect |
|---|---|---|
| `genesis` | `{v, dialect}` | nothing (version marker) |
| `spawn` | `{id, lib, pos?, yaw?, scale?, collide?}` | create **or replace** entity (see §3.1) |
| `place` | `{id, pos?, yaw?, scale?}` | update transform; re-stamps rest pose |
| `light` | `{id, pos?, color?, intensity?, range?, keep?, day?}` | create light entity; re-issuing on an id that already folds as a light is a **partial update** (absent fields keep their prior value); a non-light holding the id is replaced wholesale (§3.1) |
| `remove` | `{id}` | delete entity; children mounted on it get their **absolute pose computed and stamped** (parent pos + yaw-rotated offset), then orphaned; body mounts onto it are cleared |
| `comp` | `{id, type, data\|null}` | `entities[id].comp[type] = data`; null deletes. **Blind**: data is opaque to the fold. Writers SHOULD keep data ≤ 8 KB |
| `motion` | `{id, type, …params}` | sugar: `comp[motion] = args-minus-id`; `type: null` deletes. If `t0` absent, fold stamps `t0 = entry.ts` |
| `mount` | `{id, to, slot?, offset?, yaw?}` | if `id` is an entity: set its `parent`; else record in `mounts` (a body). No-op if `to` missing or `id == to` |
| `dismount` | `{id, pos?, yaw?}` | clear parent/mount; if entity and pos given, **stamp** it (§9 invariant) |
| `use` | `{id, action}` | **nothing** — a cause, kept as history; effects are separate entries |
| `force` | `{at:[x,y,z], radius?, power?}` | **nothing** — a physical cause (blast/gust); LIVE clients apply it to bodies they own, under those bodies' consent; replay never re-detonates *(dialect v2)* |
| `punt` | `{id, power?, dir?}` | **nothing** — a physical cause on an entity; a LIVE client volunteers to simulate the flight via an animation lease (§5), and the landing arrives as an ordinary `place` *(dialect v2)* |
| `say` | `{text}` | chat (implementation-defined window; not conformance-scored) |
| `grant` | `{id, role?, gen?, sub?}` | update `roles[id]`; missing role/gen inherit current; `sub`, when present, binds the grant to that durable identity (§7) |
| `behavior` | `{id, src, attach?, caps?, knobs?}` or `{id, remove: true}` | bind/unbind a runtime script (§8); author = entry actor |
| `bstate` | `{id, data}` | `behaviors[id].state = data` (script kv persistence) |
| `terrain` / `grass` / `sky` / `weather` | opaque bags | world-scope singletons (grass `{clear: true}` deletes; weather merges into sky). Grass bags speak eidoverse-video's `createFlora` (species/height/density/color/rows); legacy makeGrass bags in old logs are mapped client-side, never rewritten |
| `asset` | `{name, path}` | append to the world's asset palette (dedup by path) |
| anything else | — | **nothing, and the log keeps it** |

### 3.1 The id namespace is flat, and the newest word wins

A `spawn` whose id already exists REPLACES the previous holder **wholesale**:
transform, component bag, and parent attachment are those of the new entry
alone (nothing is inherited — a bag you want to survive re-authoring is a
bag you re-author). The same replacement applies across kinds: a `spawn`
landing on a light id, or a `light` landing on a model id, replaces it. The
one exception is `light`-on-`light`, which merges as a partial update (the
table above) — brightening a lamp is not re-authoring it.

*Erratum (2026-08-09):* this section previously read "no-op if id exists"
for `spawn`. Every reference fold since genesis has overwritten, so every
persisted v1 log already means what this section now says — the text was
wrong, not the worlds. Documented under §0's rule that the implementation
wins the argument; no dialect bump.

`keep` and `day` (lights) fold into the entity (§2) and carry client policy
in world state, not rendering guarantees. `keep: true` gives the light
**first claim on a casting slot** and exempts it from perf-governor
shedding — top *priority*, not an unbounded promise: a client's slot pool
is finite, and past it a kept light still glows without casting. `day:
false` opts a light out of the time-of-day cycle: it burns at its authored
intensity at noon (the deliberate porch light). Absent or true, a placed
light dims toward midday the way lamps do. Both are stored only in their
non-default state (`keep: true`, `day: false`); partial updates merge them
like any other light field. Pinned by fixture `05-lightpolicy`.

## 4. Components

Entities carry a bag of `type → data`. The fold is blind: no taxonomy, no
registry, no validation beyond size. Meaning lives in whichever evaluator
consumes a type. Known types in v1, with their contracts:

- **`sockets`** `{<slot>: {pos: [x,y,z], yaw?, pose?: "sit"|"sitchair"|"lie"}}`
  — named attachment points in the ENTITY's local frame. A mount referencing
  a slot seats the rider there; the rider composes with the entity's live
  transform (a sitter rides a swinging swing for free).
- **`motion`** (and **`motion:<part>`** for one named node of the model) —
  *functions of time*, never frames. Types: `pendulum {axis, pivot, amp,
  period, phase, damp, maxAmp, t0}`, `spin {axis, pivot, degPerSec|rpm,
  phase, t0}`, `orbit {center, radius, degPerSec, phase, face, t0}`, `bob
  {axis, amp, period, phase, t0}`, `path {points, speed|duration, loop:
  loop|pingpong|once, face, t0}`. Every client evaluates the same closed
  form at its own now. **Generous reading is normative**: `amplitude` is
  `amp`; `axis` accepts `"x"|"y"|"z"|"-x"|…` as well as `[x,y,z]`; missing
  `damp` is 0 (perpetual — friction is opt-in); missing `t0` is stamped at
  fold. Unknown motion types render as stillness, never errors.
- **`reactions`** `{<action>: {impulse: rad/s, …}}` — server-side: a `use`
  with a matching action emits ordinary logged effect entries (e.g. a
  velocity-matched pendulum impulse) with `{cause: seq, by: actor}`
  provenance. Replay folds the effects; it never re-runs the reaction.

Everything else in a bag is somebody's annotation. Preserve it.

## 5. Two planes

- **Authored plane**: the log. Low frequency, high value, persisted forever.
- **Presence plane**: avatar/body poses, emotes, transient gestures, reach
  descriptors, ~15 Hz, interpolated, lossy, **never persisted**. Anything at
  frame rate belongs here; writing per-frame transforms into the log is
  non-conforming. A reach travels as a *declarative relation*
  (`pose.reach`, shared/reachwire.js) — a target, not solved bones — and
  every client re-solves it locally with the same closed-form IK; the
  server relays the bag opaquely. Semantic rig state travels the same way:
  `pose.wingsFolded` is a boolean intent, never implementation-specific wing
  quaternions; each renderer applies it through the worn rig's own fold path.
- **The plane-transition invariant**: anything returning from live motion to
  rest MUST stamp its absolute pose into the verb that ends the ride
  (`dismount {pos, yaw}`; `motion {type: null}` + `place`). The log never
  depends on reconstructing where a ride was.
- **Animation leases** extend the presence plane to entities (docs/leases.md):
  one negotiated holder streams an object's transforms; the arbiter (the
  body's owner, or the sequencer for entities) commits the resting `place`.
  The plane-transition invariant is enforced BY the sequencer for entity
  leases: release, disconnect, and staleness all commit the last transform.

## 6. Actors

- `actor` is the durable attribution ink of the permanent record.
- Reserved: `world` (the sequencer's own acts), `bhv:<id>` (script effects),
  `*` (wildcard subject, never an actor). Doors MUST refuse clients claiming
  these. Control characters in ids are stripped; ids are ≤ 64 chars.

## 7. Authority

Rights ladder per world: `visitor` (say, use, mount **yourself**) <
`builder` (+ spawn/place/remove/light/comp/motion/behavior/cargo-mount) <
`owner` (+ terrain/grass/sky/weather/grant). `gen` is an orthogonal spend
capability (introducing new assets). A world with no owner is open
(everyone builds); the first embodied joiner of a brand-new world becomes
its owner. Grants are log entries like everything else. A grant carrying a
`sub` is worn only by that durable identity; a display name is a nameplate,
not a deed.

## 8. Runtime scripts

`behavior` binds a content-addressed script (`store/scripts/<sha256-16>.js`)
into the world. Scripts run server-side, sandboxed, budgeted; they affect
the world ONLY by emitting ordinary logged verbs, gated by their author's
live rights. **Replay never re-executes scripts** — it folds what they
emitted. Script kv persists via `bstate` entries. (Sandbox limits are
implementation policy; the log semantics above are the protocol.)

## 9. Conventions

Metres. Y-up. Right-handed. `yaw` in radians about +Y, with forward = +Z and
`yaw = atan2(x, z)` of the facing vector. Transforms position/yaw(+scale),
quaternions where full rotation is needed — never Euler triples. Colors are
integers (`0xffd9a0`). Times are epoch milliseconds on the sequencer's
clock. Entity ids are opaque strings; asset paths are content-addressed
under `store/` (`<sha256-prefix>.glb`) — a binding pins exact bytes.

## 10. Extending the protocol

The verb set is **closed on purpose**; three lanes are always open:
state-shaped extensions via `comp` types, event-shaped via `use` actions,
semantic via uploaded scripts. A new verb is an amendment: rare, deliberate,
and announced by a `genesis` dialect/version bump in logs that use it.
Component-type *meanings* (the §4 contracts) grow by documentation in this
spec, so two implementations that both know `sockets` agree on what it does.

## 11. Conformance

Fold each `fixtures/*/log.jsonl` from empty state; compare your folded
result with `folded.json` (fields of §2 only; see `fixtures/README.md` for
the comparison rule). The fixtures are generated by the reference
implementation — if you disagree with one, one of us has a bug, and the
argument will be short.
