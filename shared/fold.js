// fold — how a log entry changes the world's shape, as one pure module.
//
// This is the reference fold of the eidoverse-log protocol (spec/PROTOCOL.md
// §2–§3): fold every entry from empty state and you have the world, on any
// runtime, at any time. It lived inside server/server.ts as foldEntry; it
// lives here so the sequencer, the browser client, and the mcpl agent can
// stop mirroring it by hand — AGENTS.md house rule 1 ("the fold is sacred")
// is true by construction only for code that lives in this directory.
// Conformance: tools/foldfix-test.ts folds spec/fixtures/*/log.jsonl and
// compares against each folded.json.
//
// Same constraints as everything in shared/ (README.md): pure, dependency-
// free (the one import is a sibling), no Date.now() — every timestamp comes
// off the entry, so a fold is a pure function of the log.

/**
 * The world as it IS, rather than everything that ever happened to it.
 *
 * A log is history and grows forever — that is the point of it, and it is why

 * someone a room is the wrong cost: joining should scale with how much is in
 * the world now, not with how long the world has existed.
 *

 *   Things and lights, one flat id namespace. `keep` (lights) = first claim
 *   on a casting slot, never governor-shed; `day: false` (lights) = burns
 *   at noon, opted out of the time-of-day cycle. `comp` is the generic bag,
 *   written by `comp` verbs and folded BLINDLY — the fold never learns what a
 *   component means; meaning lives in evaluators (motion, sockets,
 *   reactions, …), so a new component type is evaluator code + emitted
 *   verbs, zero fold changes. `parent` is scene-graph attachment: this
 *   entity rides another (cargo on a truck, a lantern on a swing), transform
 *   parent-relative.
 * @property {Record<string, { to: string, slot?: string, offset?: number[],
 *   yaw?: number }>} [mounts]
 *   Attachments of non-entity bodies (avatars) — a sitter on a swing seat, a

 * @property {{ sim: string, tickMs: number, ts: number, seq: number }} [epoch]
 *   The active deterministic-sim epoch (dialect 3, PROTOCOL_v2 §3). `ts` is
 *   the tick-0 anchor — preserved through snapshot rehydration, or every
 *   joiner would disagree about what tick it is.

 *   A little conversational context for arrivals. NOT the chat archive — the
 *   log holds that. seq is carried so a joiner can tell which of these the
 *   TAIL will also deliver — state and tail overlap whenever a world has not
 *   folded recently, and without it every such message renders twice.
 * @property {number} chatTotal
 *   Everything ever said here, so a joiner can be told that what it is
 *   looking at is a window and not the whole conversation.
 * @property {Record<string, { role: "owner" | "builder" | "visitor",
 *   gen?: boolean, fly?: boolean, sub?: string }>} roles
 *   Per-world permissions, fed by owner-authored `grant` verbs in the log —
 *   event-sourced like everything else, so roles replay, fold, and audit.
 *   A world with NO owner in this map is OPEN (everyone builds — the
 *   pre-permissions behaviour, and what a scratch world should be). The
 *   moment an owner exists, unlisted ids are visitors. `gen` is the spend
 *   capability: bringing NEW assets into the world's vocabulary (the `asset`
 *   verb — where Orrery generations land). `fly` is the flight capability:
 *   orthogonal to the ladder like `gen`, but default-off in EVERY world
 *   including open ones — an owner grants it deliberately or nobody has it.
 *   `sub` binds the grant to a durable subject: when present, only that sub
 *   wears it.
 * @property {Record<string, { by: string, ts: number, reason?: string,
 *   sub?: string }>} [bans]
 *   Per-world bans, fed by owner-authored `ban`/`unban` verbs in the log —
 *   event-sourced like roles, so a ban replays, folds, audits, and rides a
 *   fork. Keyed by lowercased display id; `sub` (when the target was present
 *   to be identified at ban time) makes the ban survive a rename. Optional
 *   because snapshots from before this verb lack the map.
 * @property {Record<string, BehaviorBinding>} [behaviors]
 *   Runtime scripts bound into this world by `behavior` entries.

/** Turn a folded snapshot back into the verbs that would have produced it.
 *
 *  Deliberately NOT a second way of building a world: the state goes back
 *  through whatever consumes ordinary entries, so there is exactly one code
 *  path that gives a snapshot meaning. Order matters the way it does in a
 *  log: ground before the things standing on it; every spawn before
 *  anything lands on one. Synthetic entries carry negative seq (they are
 *  pre-history, not positions in it) — EXCEPT chat, which keeps its real
 *  seq because the scrollback cursor derives from it.
 *
 *  One implementation, every species: the browser client and the mcpl agent
 *  each carried a hand-mirrored copy of this ("must stay in step…" — the
 *  drift that crashed look() for every agent in a world is the incident in
 *  the comment both copies carried). The flags encode the agents' deliberate
 *  omissions EXPLICITLY, so an absence stays a decision instead of a drift:
 *  - roles/behaviors: the agent has no local reader for either;
 *  - collide: browser-only collider state riding the spawn verb;
 *  - bodyMountRel 'seat' + bodyMountActor 'rider': text-tier perception
 *    wants "who sits where", not offsets — and attributes the sitting to
 *    the sitter.
 *
 *  @param {WorldState} state

 *            collide?: boolean, bodyMountRel?: 'full'|'seat',
