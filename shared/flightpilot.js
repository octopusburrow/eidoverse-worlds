// It is also the cheapest possible acceptance instrument. A clip proves the
// leaf falls the way the spec says; a stick proves the SKY is a place, which is
// the thing no test can assert. Mythos's §0 stance -- albatross, not
// hummingbird, glide-biased, a body that is doing something honest between
// verbs -- is a claim about how flying FEELS, and feel is measured by flying.
//
// The seam is deliberate and narrow: this converts intent into the same input
// record a verb would produce, and the integrator cannot tell which one it got.
// A pilot and an agent fly identical physics. If they did not, the bench would
// be proving something about a bench.
//
// PURE, per shared/README.md: takes a set of held key codes and a dt, returns
// an input record. No DOM, no listeners, no clock -- the caller owns all three.
