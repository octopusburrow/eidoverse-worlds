//
// The 3.4s period is not a tunable in the same sense as the rest. It is the
// house's breath -- wing idle, stamina tick, and the leaf oscillation all beat
// on it (spec §5, §2, T8) -- so it appears once and everything that needs a
// period reads it rather than restating it.
//
// That "once" is now shared/breath.js, because the wing idle is a property of

  //
  // A polar has TWO optima and they are not the same speed. minSinkSpeed is
  // where you lose altitude slowest (circle a thermal here); bestGlideSpeed is
  // where you go furthest per metre lost (cross country here), and it is
  // always faster, because ratio is v/sink and the numerator keeps growing
  // after the denominator bottoms out.
  //
  // The first cut called minimum-sink "bestSpeed" and published its ratio as
  // "bestGlideRatio", so glideRange() under-predicted: the implemented curve
  // actually reaches 12.93 at 12.70 m/s, i.e. 388 m from 30 m and not the 360
  // the receipt claimed. A range prediction that is wrong in the FLIER'S
