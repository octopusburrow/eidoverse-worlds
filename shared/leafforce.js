// leafforce — make a REAL ragdoll fall like a leaf, by adding the forces a
// leaf actually feels rather than by animating a leaf-shaped curve.
//
// Janus: "it would be cool if you somehow used the normal ragdoll physics for
// falling, but added forces that caused it to fall like a leaf."
//
// That is the better design and it is worth saying why. shared/flight.js's
// leafAt() is KINEMATICS: a closed form that produces the right trajectory and
// is deterministic to the bit, which is what the spec's acceptance tests and
// the capture path need. But a scripted curve cannot be hit by a thrown prop,
// cannot catch a wing on a rail, cannot land badly. The ragdoll can do all
// three, and eidoverse already has one.
//
// So this is the other half: given any set of rigid bodies, return the force
// each should feel this step so that the ASSEMBLY tumbles the way a falling
// leaf does. Bullet integrates it; nothing here moves anything.
//
// THE PHYSICS, briefly, because the parameters mean something.
//
//   A flat plate falling is unstable. It does not settle nose-down; it stalls,
//   slips sideways, sheds a vortex, and rolls the other way -- the "flutter"
//   mode. Two terms reproduce it:
//
//   1. NORMAL DRAG. Drag on a plate scales with the component of velocity
//      ALONG ITS NORMAL, not with speed. Broadside-on it is huge; edge-on it
//      nearly vanishes. That asymmetry alone makes a plate seek edge-on --
//      and overshoot, because it has inertia.
//
//   2. A DISPLACED CENTRE OF PRESSURE. The aerodynamic force does not act at
//      the centre of mass; on a plate at an angle it acts forward of centre.
//      That offset is a TORQUE, and it is what turns the overshoot into a
//      periodic tumble instead of a damped wobble.
//
//   Together they oscillate on their own. The period is not authored; it falls
//   out of mass, area and speed -- which is the appeal, and also the catch:
//   the spec asks for 3.4s, and a physical leaf has whatever period its physics
//   gives it. `periodAssist` bridges that gap, and is honest about being a
//   thumb on the scale.
//
// PURE, per shared/README.md: no engine types, no globals. Callers pass plain
// numbers and apply the returned vectors with whatever their engine calls
// applyCentralForce / applyTorque.
