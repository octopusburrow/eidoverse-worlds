// flightbody — what a body must HAVE to fly, checked by name and nothing else.
//
// Janus's constraint, and the right one: "the flying mechanics should continue
// to work if I update the body as long as the load-bearing bits remain the
// same (such as wing bones), or maybe even more compatible than that."
//
// So flight is not bound to an avatar hash. It is bound to a NAMING CONTRACT,
// which is the same contract hair and wings already flow through in this
// project (rigtest/EIDOVERSE-DEPLOY.md: "the pipeline recognises bones by NAME
// and nothing else"). Re-export the body with the same bone names and flight
// keeps working; rename them and this says so, loudly, instead of producing a
// flier whose wings do not move.
//
// "More compatible than that" is the second half, and it is why this returns a
// CAPABILITY REPORT rather than a boolean. A body with no wing bones can still
// fly the physics -- the integrator moves a point through space and has never
// heard of a skeleton -- it simply cannot ANIMATE the wings. That is a
// degradation worth naming rather than a failure worth refusing, because the
// physics bench is useful on a wingless stand-in and the falling-leaf is a
// property of the body's trajectory, not of its feathers.
//
// PURE, per shared/README.md: no three, no DOM, no fetch. The caller passes a
// list of bone names, however it happens to know them.
