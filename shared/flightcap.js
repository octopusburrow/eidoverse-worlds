// Three properties matter and each exists because its absence is a specific
// way to leak flight into a world that did not ask for it.
//
// DEFAULT DENY. A missing provider is not "no opinion", it is "no". The export
// that costs nothing to reach is the one that refuses; enabling flight takes a
// deliberate act by a caller who had to construct something.
//
// CHECKED AT ACTION TIME, not at construction. mica: "avatars/components can
// hot-swap." A body that was Mythos when the controller was built may be a
// commons avatar three frames later, and a capability cached at construction
// would let flight ride across the swap. So the profile is re-resolved on every
// action, and `revoked()` exists to make the swap testable.
//
// A SEMANTIC RIG PROFILE, not an asset hash. Janus's requirement and mica's
// ruling agree: authorization binds to the load-bearing bone names, so an
// updated body keeps flying if it is still shaped like a flier. The exact asset
// hash belongs in the clip receipt as provenance, and provenance is not
// permission.
