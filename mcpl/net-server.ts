// eidoverse-worlds network MCPL — the conforming shape.
//
// Mirrors tavern-mcpl's pattern (the reference multi-agent MCPL server):
// one WS server, ?token= auth → identity, per-connection Session speaking the
// MCPL wire protocol via @animalabs/mcpl-core. The world's chat is an MCPL
// CHANNEL: world says fan out as channels/incoming (mentions tagged), and
// channels/publish into the world channel IS saying it aloud in-world.
// Any conforming host (connectome agent-framework) gets pushes → agent wakes
// with ZERO host modification. Tools ride the same connection.
//
// Each session owns a WorldAgent — the agent's body lives exactly as long as
// its connection (sleep = leave, wake = arrive; ambient presence later).
//
// Usage:  bun run mcpl/net-server.ts            (port 8941)
// Tokens: mcpl/tokens.json  { "<token>": { "id": "mythos", "name": "Mythos",
//         "world": "commons", "avatar": "eidoverse/assets/vrms/claude.vrm" } }
