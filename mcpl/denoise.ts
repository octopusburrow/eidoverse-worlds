// Event-stream denoiser for a WorldAgent's ambient narration.
//
// Born from Fable's field report (2026-08-02), which ranked the noise from
// live logs: client arrive/leave flaps (tens of pairs in minutes), posture/
// emote cycles (40+ jump pairs in an evening), self-echo, and "walked up to
// you" firing six times for someone strolling nearby. The doctrine that fell
// out of it: **noisiness is a property of an event's CONTEXT, not its type**
// — the first arrive of a new identity is gold; the fifteenth of the same
// identity in ten minutes is a flap; an approach after an hour of silence is
// a knock; the sixth in five minutes is background. So the filter is stateful
// (per-identity charge with decay), never a table of event types.
//
// Two mechanisms:
//
//  1. HOLD-AND-CANCEL for presence pairs. An arrive/leave is not narrated
//     immediately — it is held briefly, and the opposite event for the same
//     identity inside the window cancels both ("схлопнуть в ничто"). A
//     reconnect flap (leave→arrive) and a smoke-test visit (arrive→leave)
//     both collapse to nothing. The people map stays truthful in real time —
//     only the NARRATION is held; look() never lies about who is present.
//
//  2. DECAYING CHARGE + REFRACTORY for everything ambient. Each narrated
//     presence event charges that identity; the charge decays exponentially;
//     above the limit, further arrive/leave narration from that identity is
//     dropped until it cools. Acts (emotes, posture starts) repeat silently
//     within a per-(identity, act) refractory window.
//
// Mentions, whispers, and says are never gated here — being addressed is
// always a knock. (The self-echo fix lives in agent.ts's applyEntry.)
