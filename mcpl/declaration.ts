// What the eidoverse door DECLARES about itself: capabilities (MCPL SPEC §5.1),
// feature sets (§6.1–§6.2), and the tag vocabulary + producer ontology (§16).
//
// Three rules govern everything in this file, and they are the reason it is a
// file rather than three object literals inlined at the handshake:
//
//  1. **Declaration is not authorization.** Everything here is an *input* to the
//     host's decision (§5.4: "Advertisement is an input, never an authorization").
//     The door may say what it can do; it may never assert what it is entitled
//     to. Nothing in this module is ever consulted to decide whether something
//     is allowed — that is `Session.granted()` in net-server.ts, and its only
//     source is the host's `effectiveCapabilities`.
//
//  2. **Tags are never authority (§16.6).** The tag sets below describe what an
//     event IS. They never gate delivery, never open a channel, never widen a
//     grant. The door's own "is this channel open" decision is made from world
//     state, never by reading a tag array back.
//
//  3. **A suggestion must not be able to purchase a wake (§16.5).** The
//     ontology's `suggestedTreatment` deliberately contains no `immediate` rule
//     — see SUGGESTED_TREATMENT below.

// ---- tag vocabulary --------------------------------------------------------
