// eidoverse-worlds behavior SDK — the complete surface a runtime script sees.
//
// A behavior script is plain JavaScript (no imports, no async at top level —
// QuickJS sandbox, ES2023-ish). It runs SERVER-SIDE: it keeps running when
// you sleep, which is the point. It sees exactly one global, `world`, and
// affects anything only by emitting ordinary logged verbs.
//
// Write against this file locally (`bun run sdk/harness.ts yourscript.js`),
// then upload and bind:
//
//   curl -X POST "$SEQ/upload?as=script&token=$TOKEN" --data-binary @yourscript.js
//   # → {"path": "store/scripts/<hash>.js"}
//   world_verb behavior {id: "myThing", src: "store/scripts/<hash>.js",
//                        attach: "swing1", knobs: {...}}
//
// Hard limits (the sandbox enforces, the flight recorder reports):
//   25ms of CPU per activation · 24MB memory · 8 emits/activation ·
//   40 emits/min · timers ≥5s · kv ≤8KB · paused after 5 consecutive errors.
