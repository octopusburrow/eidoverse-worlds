// voice-wiring — the check that a bundler will not do for you.
//
//   bun tools/voice-wiring-test.ts
//
// Why this exists: a client module can emit an event nobody listens to, or
// call a function nobody imported, and the bundle still builds clean — the
// failure only appears in a browser, at runtime, to a user. That is exactly
// how a `caption` emit shipped with no consumer, and how this PR's own
// main.js briefly called updateVoiceMouths() while its imports were missing.
// Server smoke cannot see any of it; it is all client wiring.
//
// So: every emit has a listener, every consent gate is actually consulted,
// and the entry point imports what it calls. Source-level, no browser.
