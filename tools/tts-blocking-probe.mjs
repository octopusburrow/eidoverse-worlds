// tts-blocking-probe — does a long utterance freeze the page?
//
// R, 2026-08-16: "I submitted a long thing to test TTS hang and boy it's hung
// af — froze the whole browser. Finally came back after about 30 seconds and
// started talking."
//
// The thing to measure is not "how long did synthesis take" — RTF ≈ 1.1 means
// a long utterance legitimately takes a long time. It is whether the MAIN
// THREAD stays available while it happens. So this drives a rAF counter and
// reports the worst gap between frames: a page that never blocks holds ~16ms;
// a page doing a 28-second ort.run() shows one enormous gap.
//
// Uses a stub synthesizer with a deliberate blocking spin, so the measurement
// is of OUR scheduling, not of piper's speed — the question is whether we hand
// the page back between pieces, and that must be answerable without a 63 MB
// model in the loop.
