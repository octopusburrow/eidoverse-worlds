// lite.js — the entry point for a device that cannot hold the world.
//
// Why a separate entry point and not a flag: main.js statically imports
// { THREE, scene, camera, renderer } at its line 10, and index.html modulepreloads
// three.webgpu and three-vrm besides. Static imports and preloads are fetched and
// parsed before any of our code gets a say, so a runtime `if (lite)` would render
// nothing and still pay the whole ~2.1MB on a phone. The choice is made in the HTML,
// ahead of the module graph; see the decision script there.
//
// What this is: chat, the emote row, and who's here. No scene, no camera, no renderer,
// no bodies. You can talk to people in the eidoverse from a phone that cannot draw it.
//
// What it is NOT: a viewer. There is deliberately no canvas.
//
// It runs the REAL net.js. The wire protocol is not forked — net.js takes its
// participant registry, asset ledger and snapshot renderer by injection now, so this
// file supplies renderer-free ones and the protocol has exactly one implementation.
import { CONFIG, bus, report, setToken } from './lib/base.js';
// NOT ui.js. That module is the DESKTOP shell: since #185 it imports videopanel.js and
// profile.js, which reach the engine through core.js, mybody.js and colliders.js, and it
// owns the settings sections and world panels besides. None of that belongs on a phone
// that cannot draw a world, so lite builds its surface from the primitives that are
// actually renderer-free. Sharing ui.js would mean gutting it; this costs less and
// leaves the desktop shell untouched.
