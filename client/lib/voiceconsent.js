// voiceconsent — the two things a person must be able to say NO to before any
// audio moves: "don't send my voice anywhere" and "don't play other people's
// voices at me". Both default to OFF. Voice is opt-in in BOTH directions.
//
// Why receive-off is not just muted playback: an inbound peer connection is a
// negotiated stream, not a volume slider. If you have not opted in, we do not
// answer the offer at all — "off" means no audio path exists, not "an audio
// path exists and we discard it". Cheaper, and it is the honest reading of
// the word.
//
// Category doctrine (convention, checked against Discord/VRChat/Rec Room):
// the 🎧 toggle is a VOICE control. World ambience is taste, set once, and
// lives on a settings slider — not on a HUD button you press situationally.
// Agent voice (TTS/captions) counts as a VOICE: a resident is a resident, and
// it would be strange for a synthetic speaker to be unmutable when a human
// one is not.

// recurring negotiation, which is the opposite of asking once (review catch).
// 🔴 volWorld DEFAULTS TO 1, not 0.6 (R, 2026-08-16: "maybe we should set world
// volume to 100% by default as well. We don't really have anything to test it
// against right now but at least it will be starting from a default that makes
// sense").

// loose end (R, 2026-08-16: "we shipped some PRs related to this and closed
// them because it was getting into component-editing territory and we decided
// to punt on it. That's correct for the time being").
//
// So do not "fix" this by hunting for the missing consumer: world/ambient audio
// volume waits on the component-editing work, and the slider is the surface
// held ready for it. It is a parked feature with a visible control, which is a
// different thing from a control that lies — the TTS slider an hour ago was the
// latter, promising listener-side control that its own architecture had already
// made impossible.
//
// 1.0 rather than 0.6 for exactly that reason: 0.6 was a guess about the
// balance of a mix that does not exist yet. When ambient audio does land, the
// first person to hear it should hear it as authored, not through a 40% cut
// nobody chose on purpose.
