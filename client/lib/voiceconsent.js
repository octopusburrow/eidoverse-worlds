// negotiated stream, not a volume slider. If you have not opted in, we do not
// answer the offer at all — "off" means no audio path exists, not "an audio

// the 🎧 toggle is a VOICE control. World ambience is taste, set once, and
// lives on a settings slider — not on a HUD button you press situationally.
// Agent voice (TTS/captions) counts as a VOICE: a resident is a resident, and
// it would be strange for a synthetic speaker to be unmutable when a human
// one is not.
