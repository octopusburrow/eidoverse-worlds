// syncgate — no pipeline is ever LINKED on the render path (WebGL backend).
//
// three r186's WebGL backend builds a pipeline the first time a frame meets a render object it has no program for, and
// on that path (promises === null) it goes straight to _completeCompile, whose gl.getProgramParameter(LINK_STATUS)
// blocks until the driver has finished linking (three.webgpu.js ~75523/75697). KHR_parallel_shader_compile lets the
// link run off-thread and be POLLED, but three only takes that branch inside compileAsync. Measured on the owner's
// machine 2026-09-24 (DevTools trace, notes/eidoverse/traces/commons-boot-freeze-2026-09-24-0025.json.gz): one
// render-path getProgramParameter held the main thread 54.7 s in the Commons, and the whole browser froze with it.
// Every warm in the client (assets.js, avatar.js, sky.js, warmqueue.js …) exists to keep builds off that path; this is
// the backstop for whatever they miss (a variant change after the warm, a pass nobody pre-compiled).
//
// With the extension present, a render-path build is handed to three's own polling branch. The object is then simply
// not drawn until its program links, by three itself: _renderObjectDirect draws only when Pipelines.isReady(), which
// stays false until _completeCompile sets the pipeline (~65557/33289). It pops in late instead of stopping the world. Without the extension nothing
// changes (there is no way to link without blocking). ?syncgate=0 turns the gate off; the census stays.
//
// The census tees every render-path build that took ≥ SLOW_MS to request (with the gate off, that is the link itself),
// naming object, material and the generated shader sizes — the question the trace could not answer: WHICH material.

const SLOW_MS = 250;
// the world's own pass: no user target bound — or the target three's _renderScene binds for it (its tone-mapping
