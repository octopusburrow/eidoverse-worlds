// mictoggle — the porch-old mic badge, reborn for eidoverse. (R, 15:42: voice
// controls out of the dock, one clean SVG toggle riding beside the top-left
// HUD pane, muted by default.)
//
// Ours, whole: self-injecting like the workshop button, deletable with this
// file. States, porch doctrine:
//   grey + slash  = mic off (the default — a body should wake up silent)
//   warm ring     = mic live, world can hear you
// A small headphone glyph beside it mutes INCOMING voice separately.
// V toggles the mic from the keyboard, exactly like the porch.

// so any divergence reads as a state difference that is not there (field
// report 12:43: the off-states looked noticeably unalike). The apparent
// weight difference was never the hex — it was INK COVERAGE: the headphone
// carries two filled earcups and a long band, the mic is thin strokes with
// air between them, so identical stroke colour lands heavier on the ear.
// Equalising by giving the heavier glyph a slightly thinner stroke, which
// matches perceived weight rather than nominal colour.
