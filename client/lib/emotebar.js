    // tiles are unpressable — the exact report this clamp exists for. A bar that

    // than its room, just less visibly. The bar fits down to iw=166 (avail exactly
    // widthFor(1)=48); at iw=156 avail is 38 and it is over.
    //
    // NON-FINITE is guarded explicitly. The previous policy handled it by accident:
    // `NaN >= n` is false, so returning null kept the width, whereas Math.max(48, NaN)
    // is NaN and snapTo(NaN) paints it. It is a FINITENESS guard, not a NaN guard —
    // Math.max(48, Infinity) is Infinity and !Number.isFinite catches that too. That
    // is derived, not measured: no fixture sets innerWidth non-finite and removing
    // the guard leaves the suite green, so nothing in-repo exercises the path.
