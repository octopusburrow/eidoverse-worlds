// ragdoll — a body going limp, simulated by ONE machine and streamed.
//
// The sync model is the whole point, and it is not "make physics
// deterministic" — that is unwinnable across machines. It is single authority:
//
//   * Only the body's OWNER simulates (the VRChat model the design mandates:
//     you own your avatar). Nobody else runs physics.
//   * The owner streams the resulting sparse bone rotations through the
//     presence `pose` field — the exact channel a held pose already uses, so
//     remotes render a ragdoll with zero new receiver code: it is just a pose
//     that changes every frame.
//   * When it settles, the owner CAPTURES the final bones as a held pose. That
//     rides lastPose, so a late joiner or a reconnect gets the settled RESULT,
//     never a replay of the tumble. If it should be permanent, the same bones
//     commit as a `pose` verb into the log.
//
// So physics lives on the presence plane (lossy, ephemeral, one authority) and
// its outcome becomes state. The server never simulates and never sees a bone.
//
// The simulator is a Verlet particle skeleton — small, stable, and more than
// convincing enough for a cosmetic flop. It is NOT a jointed rigid-body
// solver; it does not need to be. What it DOES need, and for a long time did
// not have, is four things a particle sim can carry perfectly well:
//
//   MASS         — a hand must not throw the pelvis around. Every constraint
//                  splits by inverse mass, so heavy parts win.
//   VOLUME       — bones are CAPSULES, not beads. Colliding only the joints
//                  left every shaft hollow, and limbs passed clean through the
//                  torso on all 14 shipped rigs (measured: 100% shaft overlap).
//   HANDEDNESS   — knees bend backward, elbows forward. That needs a body
//                  frame, which the particles themselves supply (see _frame).
//   A FIXED STEP — Verlet's inertia term is a POSITION delta, so it silently
//                  assumes every frame lasted as long as the last one. Feeding
//                  it raw frame time made the physics a function of the
//                  framerate: measured 15.7% peak bone stretch at 60fps vs
//                  54.6% at 30fps, landing the body 10m apart.
//
// Everything anatomical is MEASURED from the rig at construction rather than
// hardcoded, because the shipped avatars disagree about nearly everything:
// heights run 0.63m to 1.53m, rests run T-pose to A-pose, and half the rigs
// carry an upperChest + shoulder pair between the chest and the arm. Absolute
// numbers tuned on one body are wrong on the next one.
