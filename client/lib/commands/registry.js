// The command registry — a PURE table. It imports NOTHING, and must stay
// that way: chat.js derives its autocomplete from this table, and the moment
// this file grows a dependency the cycle chat → commands → net → chat closes
// (§14.2). Handlers live in handlers.js and register themselves here at boot;
// this file only holds the names, the help lines, and the dispatch map.
//
// The metadata below is the user-facing command surface (what autocomplete
// shows), in display order. It replaced a hand-kept copy in chat.js that had
// drifted — a duplicate /kick row (chat.js:406/411) died in the move. Not
// every dispatchable command is listed (/use, /mount, /dismount, /debug,
// /rename ride their chat aliases or the help sheet), exactly as before:
// listing is presentation, registration is behavior.
