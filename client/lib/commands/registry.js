// The command registry — a PURE table. It imports NOTHING, and must stay
// that way: chat.js derives its autocomplete from this table, and the moment
// this file grows a dependency the cycle chat → commands → net → chat closes
// (§14.2). Handlers live in handlers.js and register themselves here at boot;
// this file only holds the names, the help lines, and the dispatch map.
//
// The table below is the WHOLE command surface now (§24l R1, survey §1):
// names, aliases, help — the one source chat.js resolves dispatch through
// AND derives autocomplete from. The first extraction moved only
// autocomplete, which left chat.js's switch as a second, drifting alias
// table (each copy carried aliases the other lacked). `listed: false`
// keeps a command dispatchable but out of autocomplete (listing is
// presentation, registration is behavior — unchanged doctrine);
// `aliasAsAction` is /use's trick: typing the alias IS the action
// (/pull lever1 → use "lever1 pull").
