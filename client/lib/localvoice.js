// localvoice — PIPER IN THE USER'S OWN BROWSER, on the human speech lane.
//
// R's constraint (2026-08-09): "a local model that the user does their own
// inference for and runs on the same speech lane that human mic voice does" —
// and explicitly NOT the server serving the models, because they are ~60 MB.
//
// So: the browser fetches the voice DIRECTLY FROM HUGGING FACE (verified
// 2026-08-09: the CDN answers `access-control-allow-origin: *`, 63 MB, 200
// after a 302), runs the inference itself, and hands PCM to the same
// setTtsSource() seam the ws:// endpoint uses. Our server never sees a model,
// and the output rides voiceSource() — the identical path a microphone takes,
// so distance, the category sliders and consent all apply by construction
// rather than by a parallel implementation that has to remember to.
//
// The endpoint box does not go away; it becomes the ADVANCED option, for a
// voice the public catalog does not have (hesperus-clockwork is ours) or a
// GPU-backed synth. Dropdown for everyone else.
//
// Caching: the runtime stores the model in the Origin Private File System, so
// the ~60 MB download happens once per voice per browser and survives reloads.
