// ONE AudioContext for the whole page.
//
// Chrome caps a document at roughly six AudioContexts and then refuses to make
// more — and a refused context does not throw where you are looking, it simply
// never produces sound.
//
// SCOPE, precisely (Mica's review of #86, and she was right to narrow it): on
// current `main` there are **two** construction sites, both in `voice.js` —
// `micAnalyserLevel` at :258 and the peer analyser at :389. The first is the
// leak that matters: a FRESH context on every mic-stream change, never closed.
// Toggle the mic a handful of times and the document is out of contexts;
// whatever asks next — the ambient bed, a peer's analyser — silently gets a dead
// one, and the world goes quiet with nothing in the console to see.
//
// (An earlier version of this header said "five from four modules". That counted
// sites across in-flight branches, not what is on main. Two is the number a
// reviewer can check, so two is the number that belongs here.)
//
// So: everybody shares this. A single context is also the only way distance,
// the category sliders and the ambient bed can compose as one gain graph
// instead of several that cannot hear each other.
