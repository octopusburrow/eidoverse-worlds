// DUAL WARM: when content loads on a headset-capable machine, warm the variant the OTHER mode will need, while the
// thing is still being warmed out of sight — so neither entering nor leaving VR finds a material it has to compile.
//
// Pattern from BasisVR (MIT, © 2024 Luke B Doolan, https://github.com/BasisVR/Basis):
//   ContentPoliceControl.cs warms a loaded avatar/prop "before we set the clone active, so the first frame it's
//   visible doesn't stall" (Basis/Packages/com.basis.sdk/Scripts/Content Police/ContentPoliceControl.cs:411-417).
// Basis warms at content load, not at the mode switch; it never deliberately warms the stereo variant (Unity's
// STEREO_INSTANCING_ON can't be put in a ShaderVariantCollection). Here both variants are warmed, because the stereo
// pass split (xrpass.js) lets them coexist.
//
// Hooked at renderer.compileAsync, where every content warm already passes (assets, avatars, flora, sky, terrain —
// through the warm conductor). Only calls with the MAIN camera and no bound render target are doubled: portraits,
// shadow depth and bakes keep their own cameras/targets and are left alone.
//   desktop  the call built the desktop variant → also compile through three's own XR camera + its persistent eyes
//            (xrpass.js withXREyes — a look-alike camera would rebind the stereo uniforms to ITS matrices)
//   in VR    three swapped in the XR camera, so the call built the XR variant → also compile with the main camera
//            into a 1×1 twin of the desktop framebuffer target (same attachment key, so the same render context
//            the desktop frames use; binding it is also what keeps three from swapping the XR camera back in)
// tools/xr-dual-warm-probe.mjs measures it: enter and exit build nothing for content that arrived in the other mode.

  // buffer — a different render context. So every compile during a session (content warms, the entry curtain) prepared
  // render objects (node builds, bindings) the headset's frames never used, and the frames built them again at draw time.
  // The GPU pipelines were NOT wasted (the pipeline cache is keyed on formats, so both contexts share them) — measured in a
  // pure-three A/B on r186 and dev: 12 render objects rebuilt by the next render(), 0 pipelines. A bound target that is
  // just the leaked output target is treated as unbound for the compile's synchronous pass (tools/xr-dual-warm-probe.mjs).
