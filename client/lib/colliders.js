// (raySegment, resolveColliders, surfaceUnder, hasFloor) transforms INTO that
// frame per entity (subtract position, un-rotate yaw, divide by live scale).
// So the merged geometry, the BVH, the lie scalar and the hasFloor verdict are
// IDENTICAL for every clone of a lib at ANY uniform scale — 20 blankets used
// to pay 20 per-vertex topLie walks and 20 BVH builds for one answer. The key
// is the lib path alone; scale needs no place in it because the product is
// scale-free (per-entity decisions apply `s` at use, as they always did).
//
// Sharing is only SOUND for a pristine clone. models.js passes `lib` exactly
// when the subtree is the untouched lib clone (promote time, before mounts
// execute, no part motion having bent a named node); every other path — the
// dismount/step-out re-fits, refit flips on already-lived objects, conjured
// meshes with no lib — keeps the per-entity build. Cache WRITES happen only

// ground at that height: a body walking the bare cloth stands 27cm up in the
// air. Issue #11's three observables — the shove at the rim, the phantom
// mantle offer, the invisible full-footprint ceiling — are all this one lie.
//
// The probe: bucket every vertex into a 24×24 grid over the footprint, keep
// the highest y per cell, and call the LIE the gap between the bbox top and
// the median cell top. One linear pass, no BVH — the BVH is the thing
// decide() is pricing, so the probe must not need one to answer. Surveyed
// against a raycast ground truth across the 58-model library plus 8 conjured
// store meshes (tools/collider-survey.ts): inside the floor-shaped population
// the gate below admits, the vertex version tracks raycast to 1.8cm worst
// case and never disagrees about the threshold. (Library-wide it drifts up to
// 2.5m on tall structured things — a watchtower, a perimeter wall — which is
// exactly why the shape gate runs before the probe is consulted.)
