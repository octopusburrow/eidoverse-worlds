// frame — the loop as an explicit system list (TEL0S_NOTES §6, §14.2 6b).
//
// The frame used to be a 60-line function body in main.js: every call
// hand-ordered, every cost invisible, and the governor pulling levers with
// no idea which system was eating the frame. Now systems REGISTER, in
// order, and the loop runs the list: each tick is timed into a rolling
// average (EW.frame() prints the bill), each carries an enable flag and a
// frame stride the governor may set (a cosmetic system at every=2 runs at
// half rate), and each is fenced — one throwing system reports (throttled)
// instead of killing requestAnimationFrame and freezing the world.
//
// Registration ORDER is the execution order, and the order carries real
// constraints (§14.1): motion before remotes (mounted bodies derive from
// parents motion already ticked), sky → materials → rig (sun position),
// voice-mouths before the avatar update that consumes them, bodydrag
// before remotes, gaze after remotes, send-pose after every myState
// writer, render last. main.js registers the list; this module knows
// nothing about any system.
//
// startFrame() is explicit: today the loop deliberately starts only after
// the identity RTT resolves — a module that self-started on import would
// change boot ordering silently (§14.1).
