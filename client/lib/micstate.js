// micstate — the mic's audio machinery, independent of how the audio LEAVES.
//
// 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-16). All of this lived in voice.js, the MESH
// transport, and voice.js was its only production caller. So the SFU — the
// transport we actually ship — published the RAW device stream:
//
//     mesh:  micStream = gateStream(rawMic, micAnalyserLevel)   // gated
//     sfu:   micStream = s                                      // raw
//
// Verified by count: 8 gate calls in voice.js, ZERO across voicesfu.js,
// voicesfubridge.js and voicesource.js. Every SFU call has been sending
// continuous room tone with the sensitivity slider doing nothing — not a
// regression, it was never wired on this transport. (voicesfu.js's own comment
// says synthetic streams are marked "so the gate is skipped", written as though
// a gate existed to skip.)
//
// Found because R asked "have you read ALL of the audio code?" — I had not.
//
// Nothing here knows about peers, SDP or transports. A transport calls
// gateFor(rawStream) and publishes what it gets back.

// 🔴 flashHint lives in ui.js, not core.js — the wrong path was a LINK-TIME
// boot-breaker in the browser (the module graph refuses to load), and
// micstate-exec-test could not see it because its core.js STUB also carried a
// flashHint, codifying the same wrong guess. Lazy-imported at the one call
// site rather than statically: a hint is UI, this file is machinery, and the
// static form dragged all of ui.js (and its THREE import) into every context
// that touches the mic — including headless ones with no DOM at all.

// module state (`muted`, `micStream`), which is why the SFU had no mute at all:
// pressing the HUD mic on the SFU path returns at voice.js:508 before touching
// `muted`, so the flag could never be set — and voicemouths.js:57 read it
// anyway, on BOTH transports. A muted mic is a fact about the microphone, not

// ReferenceError on first call, i.e. turning the mic on rejected. `node --check`
// passes on an unbound identifier and every test in place greps source text, so

 *  (2) The GATED track must NOT stop. stop() is a one-way door and a
 *      MediaStreamDestination track cannot be restarted, so re-enabling the mic
 *      would need a new graph and a renegotiation with every peer. R,
 *      2026-08-09: "we don't want to tear down audio tracks at all unless
 *      someone leaves... that's how we ran into people not hearing each other
 *      and unmute lag while it sets it all up again. Now we just mute the lane."
 *
 *  So: kill the device, leave the lane at zero gain. Senders keep a live track,
 *  no renegotiation, and reacquiring reconnects a new source into the SAME
 *  graph. The SFU had NO equivalent — sfuClose() closes the pc but never stops
