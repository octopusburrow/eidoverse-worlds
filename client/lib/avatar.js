  // than an arc, and it is the sweep that makes a flap look like it is moving
  // air rather than waving.

  // sides point opposite ways along the span).

// unchanged. Janus, having finally seen himself fly: "can we add a more
// dramatic wing flap animation for when taking off (that should be several,
// while rising) and flapping wings to move up?"
//
// "Several, while rising" is the shape of the thing. A launch is not one beat
// and not a steady cruise -- it is a burst that the climb pays for -- so the
// EFFORT is driven by the flight state (controller.js), not by a timer here:
// full through the launch impulse, full while Space is held, and decaying back
// to the idle whenever she is only gliding. The animation follows the physics
// instead of running beside it.

//
// A POSE, NOT A CLIP, for the same two reasons the flap is procedural: a VRMA
// clip can only address humanoid bones and these are not humanoid, and the
// wings must be able to stop being driven the instant the body goes limp.
// It composes through the same path _flap already uses, so folding inherits
// the ragdoll handover and the standing-up slerp for free.
//
// Authored by Janus in Blender (wings-folded_1.asset.blend, 2026-09-01) and
// read out of the action rather than eyeballed: these are the exact
// quaternions, LOCAL to each bone's rest, in three.js [x,y,z,w] order --
// Blender stores them [w,x,y,z], which is a transposition waiting to happen.
// The shoulders carry ~85 degrees and each segment outward tucks less, which
// is why the folded shape reads as folded and not as a wing pointing down.
//
// ONE EDIT to the authored pose, at Janus's eye: "compared to in blender, the
// lower wings are a bit more drastically folded - maybe reduce the amount they
// fold down by about 10 degrees?" So L/R_Wing_Lower are rotated back 10
// degrees ABOUT THEIR OWN AXIS (34.5 -> 24.5, 33.1 -> 23.1), and a second
// pass took 3 more off the UPPER pair the same way (86.6 -> 83.6, 82.8 ->
// 79.8) -- "move the upper wings *out* also ... by a quite small amount" --
// rather than having
// their components hand-tweaked -- easing an axis-angle keeps the direction of
// the fold exactly as authored and changes only how far it goes. The uppers
// and every outer segment are untouched.

   *  three-vrm's springbones are tuned for a body that is standing up: the

   *  (0.01-0.03) while stiffness is 0.35-1.3. Stiffness pulls each joint toward
   *  its rest DIRECTION, and that direction rotates with the body — so on a
   *  body lying on its side the hair is pulled sideways and world gravity is
   *  far too weak to argue. That is "the direction of gravity pulling the hair
   *  seems wrong", and it is not a bug in the springbones; it is a rest shape
   *  being applied in a pose it was never authored for.
   *
   *  A body that cannot hold its own head up cannot hold its hair up either.
   *  While limp and unowned, stiffness gives way and gravity takes over. The
   *  originals are restored on standing, so nothing accumulates.
   *
   *  This runs only where NO local sim owns the dressing — remotes, and the
   *  gap after a doll disposes. Where Bullet runs it already uses real world
   *  gravity and none of this applies.
   *
   *  CONFIRMED IN THE WORLD, 08-17. A 20s sample of a real drag showed Bullet
   *  owning the hair for 96% of it, from which the first read was that this
   *  could not be what "sideways while dragging" meant — and that was a
   *  misreading of WHICH INSTANTS were being described. Grabbing, letting go,
   *  pinning, and the fall afterwards are all springbone moments, and they are
   *  what the report was about. Dropping the center made all of it much
   *  better — but NOT completely: Janus still sees sideways hair
   *  occasionally, "significantly less often". So this is a large fix to a
   *  real cause, not the whole cause, and the remainder is an open thread
   *  (rigtest/EIDOVERSE-DEPLOY.md).
   *
   *  Two lessons, and neither is about hair. The 96% answered a question
   *  nobody had asked while the 4% was most of the story — a statistic can be
   *  accurate and still be about the wrong thing. And "confirmed fixed" was
   *  written here one report too early: better is not gone.

   *  differs per rig (the fleet splits into 19-bone and 54-bone rigs), and

   *
   *  So: park every bone the sim does NOT drive at its rest rotation, every

   *  mid-stride is deliberate — a body going limp SHOULD unclench its hands

   *  always assumed it was.
   *
   *  What this must NOT do is stop the mixer. mixer.stopAllAction() looks like
   *  the obvious move and breaks three things at once, because the actions are
   *  play()ed exactly once when they are loaded and cross-faded by WEIGHT ever
   *  after — _setAction never calls play(). Stopping them therefore:
   *    - deactivates every action permanently, so nothing animates again after
   *      you get up;
   *    - leaves head.rotation with nothing to reset it, and the head pitch
   *      composes with `+=` on the assumption that the mixer rewrote the bone
   *      first, so the head integrates one pitch per frame into a flywheel;
   *    - calls restoreOriginalState() on every binding, snapping the whole
   *      skeleton to its bind pose — a visible T-pose flash, and the Ragdoll
