// ammodoll — the Bullet body engine, ported from socketteer/ragdoll-physics.
// Same interface as Ragdoll — THE engine contract is stated on
// BodyEngineBase (bodyengine.js), which both engines extend; the shared
// measurement/format truths live in rigmeasure.js. The rapierdoll laws this
// file credits throughout are the retired third engine's.
//
// What this engine IS: Janus's measured rig, retargeted. ragdoll-physics
// derived its joint-limit tables, finger springs, tendon coupling and grab
// tuning against real avatars in Blender — and Blender's rigid-body engine IS
// Bullet, so every number transfers to ammo.js unchanged where rapierdoll had
// to re-derive its constraints from scratch. What does NOT transfer is the
// avatar contract: the source rig is a Tripo biped with rig.json baked from a
// hand-sculpted proxy mesh, Z-up, bones along local +Y. Here the rig is
// measured from the live VRM skeleton at construction (rapierdoll's approach):
// box sizes from bone lengths (rigdef.py's own skeleton-only fallback), masses
// from Dempster fractions, and every joint frame built from an ANATOMICAL
// basis — Y along the bone (twist), X the flexion axis derived from the rig's
// own forward/up (never from a node's local axes: VRM nodes sit near-identity
// at rest, so their local frames mean nothing anatomical).
//
// Structural choices inherited from the housemates, deliberately:
//
//   • THE TORSO IS ONE RIGID BODY (rapierdoll's lesson, kept): spine joints
//     cannot be defended at impact — a fold forms faster than any limit
//     responds, then ground friction pins it; measured 142° of swing against a
//     25° cone. The source keeps pelvis/spine/chest jointed because its doll
//     is posed kinematically and handled gently; ours hits the ground at
//     speed. The spine's looseness reads in the head and limbs, which keep
//     their joints (and the source's limits).
//   • REST-ALIGNED BODIES (rapierdoll's frame law, kept): each body's
//     orientation is the rotation carrying its rest configuration to its live
//     one — identity at rest — so a joint frame built from rest anatomy reads
//     the BORN excursion at build, and limits mean "from rest" the way the
//     source's tables intend. Joint anchor ORIGINS are still mapped through
//     the live transforms (zero position error at build: the rest-shaped
//     rigid torso disagrees with the live spine about where a shoulder is,
//     and handing that difference to the solver was measured at 115 mm → the
//     angular-velocity ceiling within six frames).
//   • A JOINT MUST CONTAIN THE POSE IT WAS BORN IN: every angular bound is
//     widened to admit the build pose plus slack, per axis, or the solver
//     annihilates the difference on frame one.
//
// And from the source, verbatim where it transfers:
//
//   • the full JOINTS table (rigdef.py) in degrees — elbow (−145, 2), knee
//     (0, 145), the wrist whose "X is side-to-side roll and Z is flexion",
//     the thumb's per-side sign — re-expressed on the anatomical basis;
//   • fingers as real spring bodies (btGeneric6DofSpringConstraint, stiffness
//     12 / damping 0.9, equilibrium snapshotted at build), proximal and
//     intermediate only — the distal is the measured dead end: 290° against
//     an 80° limit at the end of a three-link chain of 10 g bodies;
//   • tendons: neighbouring fingers coupled by a weak orientation spring
//     (stiffness 8), because explicit torques on 1.6e-6 kg·m² of inertia
//     NaN'd at every gain — the solver couples them implicitly and stably;
//   • solver settings (30 iterations, split impulse, step (dt, 8, 1/120)),
//     limit stiffness via btTypedConstraint::setParam (this ammo build does
//     not bind getRotationalLimitMotor — which also means NO muscle-tone
//     motors: limpness here is the source's tuned damping and limit ERP,
//     not rapierdoll's decaying tone);
//   • the grab: btPoint2PointConstraint with a hard impulse clamp — the clamp
//     is what makes a distant pin a pull instead of a teleport;
//   • body damping (0.12, 0.45), friction 0.85, restitution 0.03.
//
// WASM lifetime discipline (the source leaked ~7000 objects/second before it
// learned this): every Ammo object this instance creates is tracked and
// destroyed in dispose(); per-frame math reuses module-level temporaries.

/** The real inertia of a set of child boxes, about the body origin.
 *
 *  btCompoundShape::calculateLocalInertia is documented in Bullet's own source
 *  as "approximation: take the inertia from the aabb" — and every limb box here
 *  is ROTATED inside its compound (a body's local axes are rest-aligned, not
 *  bone-aligned), so that AABB is much larger than the box it stands for.
 *  Measured on this rig's forearm at 45 degrees off axis, the approximation is
 *  4.75x the true inertia ABOUT THE BONE — which is the twist axis, the one
 *  with the tightest limits (elbow and knee twist are +/-5 degrees). A joint
 *  whose twist inertia is five times too heavy is mis-weighted against its
 *  neighbour in every solver iteration, so the stop does not hold: the limit is
 *  pushed through and then dragged back, which reads as a limb twisting further
 *  than it should and then untwisting itself.
 *
 *  So compute it properly: exact box tensor, rotated by the child's own
 *  rotation, parallel-axis shifted to the body origin, summed, mass split by
 *  volume. Bullet can only carry a DIAGONAL local inertia, so the off-diagonal
 *  terms are dropped at the end — but the diagonal of the true tensor is a far
 *  better answer than the tensor of a box nobody has. The playground this was
 *  ported from never needed any of it: its bodies are a single btBoxShape
 *  aligned to the bone, where calculateLocalInertia is exact.

 *  mythos's upper chain has a 16cm middle bone carrying 44cm of membrane, and

 *  and copied the previous segment's length. Both distal boxes came out about a

 *  arm, so a box a third the length has a third the pull and a ninth the
 *  inertia to carry a swing with.
 *
 *  So ask the mesh instead. A vertex's position times boneInverse × bindMatrix
 *  is where it sits in that bone's frame at bind time — pose-independent, so
 *  this is computed ONCE per avatar and cached (the doll is rebuilt on every
 *  grab). Vertices are assigned to whichever bone weights them MOST, and only
 *  when that weight is decisive; a vertex split evenly across a joint belongs
 *  to neither box.
 *
