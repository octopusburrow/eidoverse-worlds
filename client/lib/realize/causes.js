// causes — the live-event dispatcher for verbs that FOLD TO NOTHING
// (TEL0S_NOTES §11.4, slice 3c).
//
// The fold handles state; these are events. A `use` is a cause whose
// effects arrive as separate entries; `force`/`punt` are physical causes
// only bodies present at the moment feel; moderation lines narrate only
// when they HAPPEN (replaying an old ban as if it just happened would be a
// lie); a live `say` is a spoken moment (chat line + speech event) whose
// RECORD the fold keeps in recentChat for the next arrival's window.
// None of that can come from a state diff — the fold deliberately shapes
// nothing for them — so the live path dispatches them here.
//
// Wired by main.js off the bus ('live-entry', emitted by net.js when the
// realizers own the scene) rather than imported by net: importing chat
// from a module net imports would add yet another lap around the
// net → chat → net cycle this rebuild is unwinding.
