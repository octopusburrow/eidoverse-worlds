// structure — the griddled-building realizer (TEL0S_NOTES §11.4).
//
// Projects every entity carrying a `structure` component into the scene: merged
// geometry through the material factory, declared boxes into the collider hash,
// and nothing else. The thinking half is shared/structure.js, which is
// pure and headless-tested; this file is the hosted half that executes its plan.
//
// WHOLESALE REBUILD, ON PURPOSE. A building's geometry is rebuilt from scratch
// whenever its component changes — no incremental patching of walls. Buildings
// are edited rarely and rendered constantly, a rebuild is a few hundred boxes,
// and a full rebuild cannot drift from the folded state the way an incremental
// patch can. That is the same trade `reconcile ∘ reconcile = reconcile` asks for
// one level up, taken one level down.
//
// MERGED, NOT INSTANCED — for now. One merged BufferGeometry per palette
// material gives one draw call per material per building, which is the win that
// matters at this scale, and it is markedly simpler than InstancedMesh (whose
// per-instance transforms buy nothing for geometry that never moves relative to
// its building). Instancing becomes worth it when a world holds dozens of
// buildings sharing one kit; client/lib/flora.js is the in-tree precedent for
// that day. Nothing outside this file addresses a wall as an Object3D, which is
// exactly what keeps that swap a private matter.
//
// TOPOLOGY IS BORN AT INIT. The palette below is created once, at module load,
// and every building indexes into it. This is the lightrig.js/materials.js
// doctrine restated: r184 keys its pipeline cache on material graph identity,
// upstream's rewrap-after-the-fact measured 44 rewraps at 2–6s each on one
// Safari join, and a runtime light-topology flip measured 388–1523ms frames. A
// building that minted a fresh node graph per style would hitch the whole scene
// every time somebody painted a wall. Style is an INDEX and a uniform, never a
// new graph.

// memory is the profiled frame-budget eater at 1.19GB), tiling that never
// visibly repeats at any scale, and a style that costs a few uniforms in an
// 8KB component instead of megabytes in the store.
//
// Every graph below is built ONCE, here, at module load. Style must never mint
// a new graph at runtime — that is the same hazard class as a light-topology
