// micgate — the noise gate as a GAIN, not a switch.
//
// R, 2026-08-09: "why not do the WebAudio graph now? I'm worried we'll forget
// about it if we wait." Right on both counts — and "later" is how a boolean gate
// becomes permanent.
//
// WHY A GRAPH AT ALL. Gating with `track.enabled` is binary and abrupt: the
// track goes from full to digital silence between one 40ms tick and the next.
// That is an audible click at both ends, and the opening click lands on your
// first consonant — the worst possible place. BasisVR gates with a smoothed
// gain (BasisLocalMicrophoneDriver: `_noiseGateGain` lerped toward 0/1 with
// attack/release coefficients), which is the right shape and needs per-sample
// access we did not have while handing the raw device track to WebRTC.
//
// The graph:
//
//     voiceSource()  →  MediaStreamSource  →  GainNode  →  MediaStreamDestination
//                                               ↑                     ↓
//                                        gate (this file)    the track WebRTC sends
//
// The analyser still reads the SOURCE side, not the gated side — measuring after
// the gate would be a feedback loop: gain drops, measured level drops, gate
// closes harder, and it latches shut. The gate must always judge the true input.
//
// 🔴 This wraps humans AND agents alike, because voiceSource() is the one seam
// both come through (a human gets a microphone, an agent gets its synthesizer).
// An agent's speech is loud and continuous, so it sails through the gate — but
// it means an agent whose synth emits room tone between utterances is quiet for
// the same reason a human is, with no second code path to maintain.

import { audioContext } from './audioctx.js';
import { report } from './core.js';

// 🔴 THESE ARE PER-CALL RATES, AND OUR CALL CADENCE IS NOT THEIRS. BasisVR's
// 0.10/0.05 are per 20ms audio frame; driveGate() runs on the 40ms onset tick,
// and a naive copy took 300ms to reach 90% gain — an audible fade-in on the
// first word, which is worse than the click it replaces. Measured, not assumed
// (a syllable is ~80-150ms, so the attack must finish well inside one).
//
// Measured at the 40ms cadence: attack 0.35 → ~90% open in 160ms (inside a
// syllable); release 0.18 → down to 10% in ~440ms, a soft tail rather than the
// 1.5s smear 0.06 produced. Attack faster than release, always: opening late
// loses a consonant, closing early cuts a word in half. And the 700ms hang-time
// runs BEFORE this fade even begins, so a pause mid-sentence never reaches it.
// TIME CONSTANTS, in seconds — setTargetAtTime reaches ~63% of the target in one
// tau and ~95% in three. Attack 0.02s → audibly open in ~60ms, inside a syllable
// (~80-150ms), so the first consonant survives. Release 0.12s → a soft ~360ms
// tail, and the 700ms hang-time runs BEFORE the fade even starts, so a pause
// mid-sentence never reaches it. Attack always faster than release: opening late
// loses a consonant, closing early cuts a word in half.
// 🔴 R: "lower the gate time to start capturing? The first syllable sounds a
// little chopped off." Two things were eating the attack and only one was this
// constant: the 40ms TICK is a floor on how fast the gate can react at all, so
// the true worst case was tick + envelope. Tick is 20ms now (below the ~30ms
// where a missing onset becomes audible) and tau is 0.008s — ~95% open in 24ms,
// so worst case ~44ms instead of ~160ms. A plosive is ~20-40ms, so this is the
// difference between "puh" and "uh".
