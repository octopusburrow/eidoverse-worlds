// simworld — the client half of the deterministic sim (PROTOCOL_v2,
// dialect 3). state.js folds the intents; this module ADVANCES the sim to
// the tick "now" quantizes to and applies body poses onto the realized
// entities, every frame, through the engine's own hook array.
//
// Nothing here is authoritative and nothing here is sent anywhere: the sim
// state is a pure function of the log (plus the adopted join cut), the
// sequencer computes the identical states independently, and this module
// only makes them VISIBLE. Clock skew between this machine and the
// sequencer shifts the flight's phase by the skew and nothing else — the
// rest pose is recomputation, not observation, and cannot drift.
//
// Presentation INTERPOLATES between ticks (PROTOCOL_v2 §5: "clients
// interpolate presentation between ticks exactly as they interpolate
// presence"). The sim's tick-T state is where a body stands at wall time
// epoch.ts + T·tickMs, and tickOf rounds UP — so the sim's current state is
// the END of the interval "now" falls in, and the state one tick earlier is
// its START. Each frame the applier remembers every body's position at the
// tick before advancing across a boundary, then shows the lerp of the two at
// the fractional phase of now within the tick: exact sim time, zero added
// latency, no extrapolation (nothing ever overshoots a bounce or the ground).
// At 15Hz ticks on a 60Hz+ display the tick-stepped v0.1 painted each
// position four frames running (tel0s, playtest 2026-09-01: "I can sort of
// see the individual physics updates in the form of juddering"). Not one
// number the sim owns is touched: the displayed lerp never feeds back, and
// the parity legs read state.sim, never obj.position.
