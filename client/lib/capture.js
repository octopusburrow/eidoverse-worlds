// capture — the one framebuffer-readback primitive (RENDERER-SEAM move 1).
//
// "Render the world and hand me the pixels" existed as private copies in
// the wire protocol (net.js snap requests) and the command dispatcher
// (screenshots) — a protocol file and a chat file each owning a renderer
// call. This is the only module outside the designated presentation layer
// allowed to say `renderer.render`; when the renderer is ever swapped,
// frame capture is one function, not a grep.
//
// Deliberately NOT unified here: avatar.js's portrait pipeline. It is an
// offscreen-SUBJECT renderer (its own RenderTarget + isolated Scene +
// async pixel reads, transparent background), not a capture of the live
// frame — one primitive with five booleans would be worse than two honest
// ones (the R2 ladder lesson).
