// voice — proximity voice chat between the humans in a world.
//
// Ported from porch-old (index.html:9751-9822), blessed by exultation doctrine:
// WebRTC is wrong for STATE, fine for MEDIA — a P2P mesh for room-sized voice,
// LiveKit if a world ever outgrows it. Signaling rides the sequencer as `rtc`
// messages: point-to-point, never logged (same privacy reasoning as whispers).
//
// Shape: 🎙 on → getUserMedia → offer to every human already here; anyone who
// arrives while your mic is live gets an offer too. A peer with their mic OFF
// still answers offers (recvonly) — hearing needs no microphone. Agents are
// skipped (r.agent — they hear through STT transcripts in the say log, which
// also leaves their mention/approach/whisper triggers untouched).
//
// Mute ≠ mic off: mute disables the outgoing tracks but keeps the mesh warm.
// Volume rolls off by avatar distance — voice is proximity-scoped like chat.
