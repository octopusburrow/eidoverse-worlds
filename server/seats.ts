// seats — the server side of seat profiles (#101): storage, judgment, push.
//
// One judge, three readers. This module owns the profile store
// (assets/opt/seats/profiles.json + an append-only provenance log), computes
// the serve-time verdict against the CURRENT bytes on disk (via seatcore,
// the same file every consumer evaluates), and tells the server when to
// broadcast `avatar-profile-updated`. Consumers never rehash a VRM and can
// never read a stale value as fresh — the verdict ships pre-judged.
//
// Write authority (design round, B4): HTTP proposals require a NAMED actor
// (a tokens.json bearer or a home-node-verified aid1 identity — the same two
// legs /upload trusts); the anonymous door token may not write here, because
// a seat profile moves every wearer of an avatar and "?by=" is self-asserted.
// The countersign that makes a profile load-bearing has NO HTTP path at all:
// tools/seat-accept.ts is run by the operator on the box, edits the store
// through this module's own functions, and the running server notices via an
// mtime watch — reloading, diffing, and pushing the update event. Bearer
// tokens are never logged and never echoed.
//
// Integrity boundaries (#105 review, B2/B3 — each rule is that review):
//  - the maps are NULL-PROTOTYPE and the keys are schema-refused reserved
//    names besides: "__proto__" cannot reach an inherited slot here even if
//    a future validator regresses;
//  - proposals name a ROSTER avatar (the bytes must exist to judge against);
//    the operator-import lane may explicitly carry an unrostered name, and
//    the flag is provenance;
//  - every write is PROVENANCE-FIRST: the log line is appended before the
//    snapshot renames, the in-memory store swaps only after both, and no
//    caller reports success (or broadcasts) before the swap. A crash between
//    log and snapshot leaves the log AHEAD — startup folds it forward. A
//    snapshot ahead of its log is a state with no receipt: quarantined,
//    served as missing, said loudly. Provenance ⊇ applied state, always;
//  - writes are SERIALIZED across processes (#105 review round 2): the store
//    has two real writers — the live server and the offline operator tool —
//    and a check-then-act freshen was provably interleavable (two contradictory
//    records at one revision, forced by the reviewer on the prior head). Every
//    mutation now runs whole under one shared on-disk lock: acquire → forced
//    reload (never mtime trust) → precondition re-check → provenance append →
//    snapshot rename → in-memory swap → release in finally. Lock acquisition
//    is bounded and explicit — a timeout changes nothing anywhere and says
//    so; a lock older than its liveness window is declared stale, broken,
//    and noted. The countersign additionally requires the revision the
//    operator REVIEWED — under the lock, an interleaved proposal moves the
//    revision and the acceptance refuses rather than bless the unseen.
