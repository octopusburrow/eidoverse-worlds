// The first slice of the behavior runtime: an entity's `reactions` component
// maps a use-action to an effect. The shape is the general one — triggers in,
// ordinary logged verbs out, cause carried in the entry — even though only one
// effect kind exists so far (a pendulum impulse: the swing). Reactions run
// with WORLD authority precisely because the trigger is rank 0: a visitor may
// push the swing, and the push moving the swing is the AUTHOR's standing
// decision (they attached the component), not the visitor's rights.
//
// Wrapped whole in try/catch: no reaction may ever take the server down
// (lesson of the 4f82250 crash loop — a ws handler must never leak a throw).
