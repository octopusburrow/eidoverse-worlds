// The unsplit World class decomposes into two collaborators behind ONE thin
// facade:
//   WorldLog     — the authored plane at rest. Entries, the folded state (the
//                  fold IS the log's projection, so state lives beside the
//                  entries it summarizes), the snapshot byte-offset
//                  bookkeeping, remembered poses — and every file under
//                  worlds/<name>/.
//   WorldSession — the embodied plane in flight. Connected clients, the
//                  dirty-pose batch, entity leases, stage-frame bookkeeping.
//                  Never persisted. Depends on the log ONE WAY (settleLease
//                  commits outcomes as `place` entries); the log never learns
//                  sessions exist.
// The World facade preserves the unsplit public surface exactly, so
// server.ts's call sites, behaviors.ts's WorldLike, and verbs.ts's VerbWorld
// all hold without edits. The registry (getWorld/forkWorld/worlds) lives here
// too; the boot sweep that CALLS getWorld stays in server.ts — waking
// scripted worlds with the server is boot policy, not world mechanics.
