// boxes — the sequencer's word on what a model's geometry IS, for the log.
//
// PROTOCOL_v2 Covenant III: the sim may depend on nothing that is not stamped
// into an entry. A model's bounding box is an ASSET fact — it lives in a GLB,
// not in history — so before eidosim@0.3.0 can collide bodies with the
// world's things, the sequencer writes the box into the log exactly as it
// writes `ts`: `spawn.box` on every model spawned under a live epoch, and
// `epoch.boxes` (lib → box) for every model already standing in the world
// when an epoch is entered (ruling: tel0s, 2026-09-01). Clients never author
// a box; a client-supplied one is discarded at validation.
//
// Validators are synchronous (verbs.ts), and summarizing a GLB is not — so
// this is a warm cache: `warmBoxes` is awaited on the wire before a spawn or
// epoch reaches its validator (messages.ts) and fired on every join for the
// world's standing libs, and `boxOf` answers instantly. A lib whose file
// cannot be summarized is remembered as boxless (null): the entity is simply
// not a collider — the fold shapes nothing wrong, it just knows less.
//
// Boxes are rounded to millimetres: the log should carry a number a human can
// read and a diff can compare, and a millimetre is below anything the sim's
// contact law can resolve at 15Hz.
